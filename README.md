# Heroes of PyMoli

## Background

Initially, created a repository and then cloned it onto the computer. Further, made changes on the local repository and then pushed it on to GitHub. The task is to analyze their most recent fantast game **Hereoes of PyMoli** in an independent gaming company. 

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The first task is to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
